<!-- Write your personal summary below. You can use Markdown formatting. -->

I define myself as a Software Professional, a generalist with a background in teaching, software development and Agile coaching. I see Product Development as a continuum, going from an idea that evolves and develops into something that is valuable to other people.

I originally started my career as a high school teacher, a vocation from childhood times. It is because of this that I naturally have a passion for getting the best out of the people and teams I work with. I coach and serve the teams in applying Agile practices with a clear focus on High Performance and Kaizen (continuous improvement).

I have over 10 years of proven experience developing software applications using the .NET framework.

This experience has allowed me to gain respect and build rapport with development teams, being able to speak their language and understand their issues to help find solutions.
