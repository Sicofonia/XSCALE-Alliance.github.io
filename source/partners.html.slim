            h3 Strategic Partnership
            p XSCALE Strategic Partners are consultancies, training providers and corporate coaching colleges that employ a cadre of certified XSCALE coaches. Benefits of strategic partnership include:

            h3 Service Provider Certification
            p Similarly to commercial Linux providers, Alliance members offer training, coaching, tailoring and consulting to help organizations apply the XSCALE practice pattern language.
            p The Alliance offers commercial certification of XSCALE Coach/Trainer expertise. XSCALE coaching isn't specific to individual practitioner roles, but to team practices, so these certifications are offered in:

          ul
            li For each XSCALE discipline there are just two levels of certification, Practitioner and Coach. There's no distinction between coaches and trainers. Trainers can coach and coaches train. 
            li Practitioner certification has no yearly dues, experience requirements, or sunset clauses. It just means the holder proved their literacy in the discipline. Real world mastery depends on real world experience.
            li XSCALE Alliance maintains a Contributor community who do pay dues in exchange for participation in online and offline networking and continuous access to the latest shared collateral. 
            li These Contributors aren't motivated to pay to keep their certificates up. There are no sunset clauses because it's not like you magically forget what you know if you don't pay a tax.
            li Stewards are senior community members authorized to train Coaches. Stewards provide <a href="">Leadership as a Service</a> to the Coach community to assure consensus on evolution of training and reference collateral. Stewards regularly meet in a council focused on evolution of the ecosystem as a whole. 
            li Strategic Partnership doesn't entail equity or directorial obligations and isnâ€™t exclusive in any way; partner organizations may keep up whatever other affiliations they like. 
            li Nevertheless, to qualify as a strategic partner you must employ a minimum number of Coaches or Stewards. In return, strategic partners gain a discount on certification fees for their staff and clients.
            li XSCALE Alliance is producing a set of <a href="">cross-promotion guidelines</a> that govern the way its strategic partners feature in online and offline collateral and events.
