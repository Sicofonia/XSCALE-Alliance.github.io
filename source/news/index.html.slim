              p Alliance members with something XSCALE-related you'd like to post, just add it in the appropriate slack channel and we'll pick it up.
              p Or fork the repo, make a post and send a pull-request. PRs don't have to originate in XSCALE - if it's cuttting edge on agile organization we'd love to share it.
              p If you're not in the Alliance but just want to have a chat about XSCALE, come spend time in our Telegram group. Sit a spell. Kick your shoes off. Y'all come back, y'hear?
