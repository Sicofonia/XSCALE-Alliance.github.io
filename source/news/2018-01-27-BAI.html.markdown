# Why is this MOU important to XSCALE Alliance?

Evan Leybourn’s BAI ran the world’s first Business Agility Conference in New York in 2017 and lit the way forward with the most comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of agile organization today. 

XSCALE’s principles and pattern languages provide an agnostic praxis to fulfil the BAI taxonomy., We’re chopping down the Agile greasy pole of vanity certificates to provide a #NoFramework ecosystem of independent coaches collaborating on the Linux of the agile world - an open content kernel wrapped in commercial training, coaching and tooling products.

XSCALE has signed an MOU with BAI to make it clear that each supports the other. People scrap over Agile frameworks but for us these arguments fall away when we focus on business throughput first. Which is why we say Agile in IT is nonsense. Meaningful agility lives and dies with the business.
