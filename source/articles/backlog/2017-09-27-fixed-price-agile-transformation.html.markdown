The conventional view of transformation is challenged by a fixed-price,
low-risk,
[ecosystems-thinking](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/12-principles-ecosystems-thinking-peter-merel/)
alternative. Growing a slender, self-propagating capability is quicker,
cheaper, safer and better than pushing change into existing teams and
streams.

In practice this approach takes about three months to grow its initial
in-house starter culture: product design, delivery and devops working
hand-in-glove with quality automation, service automation, and
end-to-end throughput analytics. [Not just a
scrum](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-earth-wrong-scrum-peter-merel/),
but a self-directing portfolio of self-managing streams of
self-organising teams.

Such an agile starter culture doesn\'t require external training or
coaching after its inception because it has a built-in ability to
propagate itself. Using agile to roll out agile, iteratively
transforming change participants into change leaders. It\'s not what the
\"[Agile Industrial
Complex](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/disrupting-agile-industrial-complex-part-one-peter-merel/)\"
sells, but [it\'s how Gandhi did
it](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-agile-transformation-quicker-cheaper-safer-peter-merel)
\...

Using agile to roll out agile

Some may doubt my sanity in promoting this alternative, but it\'s worked
well in multple engagements and I challenge traditionalists to fault its
logic:

1.  **A team can only change as fast as its most change-resistant
    member.** So we begin by cherry-picking the client\'s most
    progressive staff to form a starter culture. We never push change
    onto existing teams and streams. We pull the organization into the
    new culture at its most effective rate.
2.  **The best way to learn French is to move to France.** When learning
    a new language, instruction is slower, harder and much less
    effective than immersion. You need to train and coach your first
    agile tomato plant, but once it\'s producing you can just split it
    in two and fertilise each. You define business drivers and budgets
    for each of the two \"cuttings\" and permit your next most
    progressive people to join and immerse in them. The new capability
    proves its pudding at every split, de-risking as it grows.
3.  **\"Agile Coaches\" can\'t and don\'t cover the full change stack.**
    An uncompromised agile value stream needs coaching in business
    agility, product management, and devops to become self-sustaining.
    That\'s too much for one coach to cover, so most \"Agile\" cultures
    appear half-arsed. With two or three coaches who together cover all
    these needs, the starter culture grows a full arse!
4.  **Training without coaching is nonsense.** Spending money on some
    super-charismatic, super-certified but non-practicing trainer to
    spend 2 days talking up an Agile framework in a boardroom is pure
    waste. Unless you\'re trying to collect all the certificates. In a
    self-propagating transformation, training is an integral part of
    coaching. There\'s plenty of material online that a coach can use
    for training, and (commercial plug) XSCALE Alliance is an [open
    community of independent coaches collaborating on well-structured
    courses that cover all of the critical agile disciplines a fixed
    price transformation
    needs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/honorable-agile-ecosystem-peter-merel/).

The Tomato Rebellion
--------------------

It doesn\'t matter if there\'s no fully agile tomato plants in your
garden today. You can begin by cherry-picking about a dozen of your most
progressive staff to start one. Your change champions. Your
trouble-makers.\"[The crazy
ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rwsuXHA7RA)\" driven to make it
all make sense. Just a few rebels each in business, design, delivery and
devops \...

What if you don\'t have any rebels? You\'re in for a surprise. The
craziest people turn out to be the ones who believe change is bad, and
they\'re actually quite rare now. Most people in your business are
keenly interested in progress. Each shelters a little rebel in their
hearts. But they need leadership to establish psychological safety to
try new things that require learning to get right. They need to know you
trust them before they will put their inner rebels to work.

This also means you can\'t start, as many traditional transformations
have tried to do, by \"clearing the dead wood\". If your culture needs
change, you don\'t know what wood is dead and what\'s ready to bud and
root and flower anew. Sacking people you think will resist will make
many more people resist. Sustainable changes begin with servant
leadership. [Demonstrate trust and safety though Leadership as a
Service](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/).

After the first of these tomato plants is working, and then working
reliably, and then working fast, we split and re-pot. It doesn\'t all
happen in synchrony because we only split and double when an agile value
stream mature -- not only its capability for agile delivery, but its
capability to self-propagate.

This way we create no disruption, no politics, and no compromises, no
half-a-cow-half-a-fish. Just real top line business agility. The only
real hurdle is realigning change leadership, product leadership and
executive leadership to the self-propagating change model. And, if
that\'s your problem, (commercial plug) [**here\'s the
solution**](https://xscalealliance.org/xlots/)**.**
