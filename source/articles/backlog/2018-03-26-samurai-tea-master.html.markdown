Two distinct learning patterns struggle in the heart of agile culture.
The *shu ha ri* training hierarchy instituted by the tyrant
[Hideyoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi) to
reinforce his samurai caste system. And the *mu hin shu* learning
ecosystem invented by tea master
[Rikyū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_no_Riky%C5%AB) to remedy two
centuries of civil war. This is the story of the two men, and of how
differences between their learning patterns have become critical to
agile transformations today.

To talk about tea I think I should start with my own little part of the
story. I served tea from 2003 to 2005 in a rainforest teahouse at
Limpinwood, Australia. It was scones and cream, not matcha and kimonos,
the commonwealth style preferred in counter-cultural Tweed Shire. At no
other time in my life have I learned as broadly and deeply as those
years. The little video above is the best I can do to convey the spirit
of the place.

Rikyū

In 16th century Japan a similarly spirited community of Korean-backed
tea merchants led by [Sen No
Rikyū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_no_Riky%C5%AB) ended Japan\'s
two hundred year civil war by creating a new way of tea. Mentored by
famed tea-poet [Jōō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeno_J%C5%8D%C5%8D)
and sponsored by progressive warlord
[Nobunaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga#Culture), Rikyu\'s
ecosystem disrupted the older Chinese-derived tea tradition where nobles
met in gilded palaces to sip from polished porcelain. Rikyu served on
cheap and mended crockery in the seclusion of rude huts set in remote,
meandering gardens, [*wabi
sabi*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1gxziZwmkc) style.

These tea houses formed a network that shared information across the
warring hierarchies. Participants put aside symbols of rank to take tea
together as peers; merchants, warriors and nobles speaking heart to
heart. The entrances to the tiny huts were made low enough to force even
the highest lords to bow. The tea implements were shared and admired for
their blemishes, mendings, and the sad stories of their journeys from
hand to hand. Far from the ascetic rituals practiced in Japanese tea
today, Rikyu\'s tea was simple, social and experimental, working on
variables of time, heat and protocol to improve both quality of
experience and the mutual benefit to the participants.

Rikyu himself left almost no writing about just how his tea was served.
We know only from his ill-fated colleague,
[Soji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanoue_S%C5%8Dji), that its
ultimate goal was *mu hin shu* -- literally \"no guest, no host\". The
tea huts formed a
[semi-lattice](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf)
of conversation to support trust relationships that couldn\'t form any
other way. While historians attribute the end of the civil war to the
battle strategies of one or another warlord, it was in reality the
change in social fabric that generated the national stability that
lasted for the next three centuries. Not for want of quarrelsome nobles,
either. But then, \"no good deed goes unpunished\" \...

The Morning Glory
-----------------

:::

On the verge of peace, Rikyu\'s patron Nobunaga was overthrown in a
violent coup. He was succeeded by
[Hideyoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi), a
self-made samurai who\'d started life as a peasant and carried a chip on
his shoulder. Seeming as sympathetic to Rikyu\'s tea as his predecessor,
Hideyoshi appointed Rikyu to court, had the emperor name him, and
ordered his generals to study under him. Within a decade, however,
Hideyoshi would order Rikyu\'s death by *seppuku*.

In memory of Nobunaga, Rikyu had planted a field of morning-glories
around his teahouse. The flower was recently introduced to Japan and
considered a great novelty. Word spread of the beauty of the display and
Hideyoshi announced he would inspect it. Upon his arrival, however, he
found the flowers all plowed under the ground and only turned earth in
their place. Hideyoshi stormed into the teahut, furious at the insult,
to find Rikyu calmly boiling water beside a vase containing the last
fading blossom.

Rikyu might have intended this to illustrate [wabi
sabi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1gxziZwmkc) to the new regent. Or
he might have thought this would effectively wrong-foot Hideyoshi so as
to insulate Rikyu\'s Korean trading partners against the tyrant\'s
invasion plans. Or both. Or neither. With no eyewitness account, this
incident may never have happened at all. Still, the story circulated.
While the regent may have lost face by his misunderstanding, he
couldn\'t tolerate the independence of Rikyu\'s teahouses. Step by step,
the samurai set out to defame the tea master.

An Honorable Disembowelment
---------------------------

:::

Hideyoshi\'s lieutenant
[Oribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furuta_Oribe) documented every
detail of Rikyu\'s tea service. Before kettles, thermometers and clocks,
to prepare tea reliably required great precision in manual measurements
and movements. Circulation of Oribe\'s notes broke samurai dependence on
the community of tea masters. Rather than collaborating to innovate and
maintain communities of trust, however, the samurai teas focused on
standardising tools and processes of brewing.

Hideyoshi ordered Rikyu to design a grand golden tea-pavilion in his
palace of *Jurakudai.* Here Hideyoshi himself ran Oribe\'s tea procedure
for hundreds of lords and their retainers. Serving on a vast collection
of imported china, it is unreliably reported that Hideyoshi required
Rikyu\'s daughter to assist in these events as his concubine.

In any case his plan made rapid progress. Hideyoshi declared that
[Soji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanoue_S%C5%8Dji), Rikyu\'s
friend and biographer, had made a plot against him with
[anarchists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikk%C5%8D-ikki) to serve
poisoned tea in an assassination attempt. Soji was tortured and
executed. A systematic purge of Rikyu\'s inner circle followed.

A year later Hideyoshi announced that a statue of the Buddha appearing
above a gate in the *Jurakudai* had been intentionally designed to
resemble Rikyu, and that by forcing the regent to walk beneath it Rikyu
had shown brazen disrespect.

Hideyoshi ordered the tea master crucified. Rikyu\'s remaining
supporters petitioned for mercy. After some debate the regent saw fit to
grant it. Only the statue need be crucified. Rikyu was permitted the
samurai privilege of disembowelling himself.

The Shu Ha Ri Racket
--------------------

Hideyoshi next barred commoners like himself from making tea, bearing
arms or becoming samurai. With Japan at peace internally, he made a war
on Korea. He ordered 300,000 to their deaths before himself dying of
bubonic plague.

Hideyoshi\'s successor, the first [*Shogun
Tokugawa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu)*,* restored
the Sen family name to Rikyu\'s grandchildren with an exclusive license
to conduct tea instruction -- based, of course, on Oribe\'s standard
methods. The *Mu Hin Shu* era was over.

:::

On the hundredth anniversary of Rikyu\'s death, a forged book,
*Namporoku,* was discovered to contain the tea master\'s secret inner
doctrines. *Namporoku* explained that Rikyu was in fact a mystical
guardian spirit of tea. It prophesied a new tea-saint would now appear.
By coincidence, the description of the new saint closely matched that of
the discoverer of the book \...

*Namporoku* for the first time connected tea to zen. It represented a
direct challenge to the teachings of the *Senke* school. Soon [dozens of
zen tea
schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_Japanese_tea#Current_schools)
sprang up to
[squabble](http://%20https//scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/9891/uhm_phd_9604172_r.pdf?sequence=1)
over the most profound colour of a tea whisk, enlightened ways to fold
tea-towels, and cosmic symmetry in the layout of implements on the tea
tray. Antique tea paraphernalia traded for vast sums, tea services
extended to hours of silent meditation, and markets for philosophy,
instruction and certification in tea went
[exponential](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-event-horizon-peter-merel).

To regain market dominance, the *Senke* engaged a samurai, *Fuhaku,* to
introduce his [*Shu Ha Ri*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari)
training hierarchy to tea culture. Starting in the capital city of Edo
and basing his system on Zeami\'s 14th century Noh plays, Fuhaku\'s
training hierarchy spread via the social network of tea service to every
martial and aesthetic school in Japan.

The idea was simply that *Shu* training recipients must display strict
obedience to *Ha* teachers while paying for the privilege. These
teachers would purchase licenses from *Ri* masters (\"*Iemoto\"*) who
derived their authority by blood or zen from Rikyu. Money flowed up,
training passed down, and peer to peer learning communities were swiftly
out-marketed.

*Mu Hin Shu* and Agile

Eight years before opening my Limpinwood Teahouse I took part in a
learning community called [Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardsWiki). Before
the Agile Manifesto, XP books and Scrum certificates, Ward Cunningham
invented the first wiki to share software design patterns. Ward\'s
sometime partners Beck and Jeffries saw the place as an ideal community
to field-test all the practice patterns we now call Agile. Our community
had no trainers or frameworks then, but applied a kind of *Mu Hin Shu*
we called the [WikiNature](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiNature).

> [WikiNature](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiNature) is adding value by
> removing that without. ---- Ron Jeffries

It was a wonderful period of innovation, but it took only a few years
for the pendulum to swing back. After the first XP conference [Alistair
Cockburn](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri) introduced *Shu Ha Ri*
to Agile culture. These days he wears it proudly tattooed on his body.
And soon the Scrum machine converted Schwaber and Sutherland\'s little
book of standards into billions of dollars of CSMs.

When management consultancies smelled the dollars they settled into a
paradigm of \"Big Transformation Up Front\" with no measurable end or
outcome. The [Agile Industrial
Complex](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/disrupting-agile-industrial-complex-part-one-peter-merel/)
of frameworks, certificates and consultants grew into a torrent while
Ward\'s wiki fell into disrepair, a disused backwater beset by trolls
and eventually shuttered.

The Kiai Masters
----------------

The problems you see in this video aren\'t Aikido; Aikido is a deep
martial art with a sound philosophical basis and many [useful practice
patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VOb2YBBr7E). It\'s the
unquestionable *Ri* grand masters selling a training hierarchy they call
Aikido in the place of the learning ecosystem that originated Aikido.
This same anti-pattern is so commonplace in Agile it\'s become
fashionable to say [Agile is
dead](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-dead-peter-merel/).

The result is a culture in which all frameworks claim to \" work\"
despite a [nearly universal failure to achieve business
agility](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-96-agile-transformations-fail-peter-merel/).
The alternative - to instill *Mu Hin Shu* learning ecosystems in our
clients - requires that we professional coaches stop accepting this as
normal and re-form a [learning
ecosystem](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/honorable-agile-ecosystem-peter-merel/)
of our own.

Instead of *Ha* change agents training *Shu* change recipients to
achieve some unobtainable *Ri* change-enlightenment, we need to apply
agile to the work of delivering agile, acting as servant-leaders to
change participants and measuring the effect of our work on actual
top-line [business
throughput](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95poI68g7-E&index=3&list=PLcF9BigzPGr3Fsema6jErOT8xwz0HR7NU)
analytics. Without that, we will never be able to claim with any
integrity that any of this stuff \"works\".

And that\'s the intent of [self-propagating
transformation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fixed-price-agile-transformation-peter-merel/).
But how do we track it? Prioritise it? Optimise it? If we can\'t put it
on a kanban and continuously pull it toward Done, tracking real business
benefits day by day, what we do is just more \"no touch\" Kiai mastery.
How to go about the pragmatics of this work will be the subject of the
next post in this series: the *Seven Samurai Kanban*. If you can\'t wait
for that, there\'s a little slide deck about it after one last glimpse
of the view from my dear old Limpinwood teahouse:

Further Reading
---------------

A vast body of tea literature has descended from the writings of Joo,
Soji, Oribe and whoever wrote Namporoku. For reasons I hope are now
clear, none of it should be taken seriously. But if you\'re interested
in digging into tea history, here are some great sources:

    Tradition](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/9891/uhm_phd_9604172_r.pdf?sequence=1).

    tea.

Two learning patterns struggle in the heart of agile culture. Shu Ha Ri
training hierarchies and Mu Hin Shu learning communities both derive
from Japanese tea, and those who forget history are doomed to repeat it
