Round Councils eliminate bureaucracy to accelerate **\#businessagility**
and **\#devops**. They empower self-organizing teams to self-manage,
which radically accelerates the third learning loop: the flow of
learning across the organization.

Forces
------

1.  [The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
    self-organizing teams.](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
    While teams of six or less easily self-organize using the
    [Leadership-as-a-Service](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/)
    patterns, they still need a way to coordinate their decisions about
    these things with those of other autonomous teams.
2.  [The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
    and within a team is face-to-face
    conversation.](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) Delegating
    alignment to managers / masters [generates
    politics](https://ncase.me/trust/) that limits responsiveness to
    change.
3.  Bringing team representatives together in a [Scrum of Scrums impedes
    learning
    flow](https://portal.netobjectives.com/articles/alternatives-to-scrum-of-scrums/)
    by mixing up different kinds of cross-cutting concern. Where
    alignment decisions must be made, team representatives still compete
    to influence a shared manager. And team members who don\'t attend
    are inadequately represented.
4.  Bringing all managers, masters, owners and teams together in \"big
    room meetings\" reinforces top-down command and control, inhibits
    teams from responding autonomously to learnings outside the big
    rooms, over-commits teams to detailed plans up front, and violates
    [the Real Dunbar
    Number](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/right-sized-squads-streams-tribes-peter-merel/).
5.  \"[Spotify chapters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GK1NDTWbkY)\",
    where members of different teams who carry out similar functions
    come together regularly (and in parallel so teams are not starved of
    their services) accelerate cross-team communication and inform team
    retros. But they provide no way to make alignment decisions apart
    from delegation to managers, giving rise to problems per item \#2 in
    this list.

**Therefore,**

> To align autonomous teams, we represent cross-team but same-function
> circles, round-robin, on a council whose decision-making
> responsibilities are limited to prioritization and simplification of
> circle proposals.

1.  **Assign product metrics to cross-team circles:** Different team
    members have different kinds of expertise in understanding different
    fields of constraints. Yet decisions and trade-offs must be made in
    a timely manner. **Therefore,** hold circle meetings prior to team
    retros. Assign responsibility for specific product or service
    metrics to specific circles so DRIs ([Directly Responsible
    Individuals](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/))
    are systematically identified.
2.  **Circles propose product features & team treaties:** When different
    teams make trade-offs independently, they may make decisions that
    are not mutually beneficial about priorities, dependencies and ways
    of working. **Therefore,** let circles, not teams, propose changes
    to products and services (\"Features\") or changes to ways of
    working (\"Treaties\") between teams. A circle only makes proposals
    its members unanimously agree will improve the product or service
    metrics for which their circle carries responsibility.
3.  **LaaS councils represent circles, not teams:** Circle proposals are
    made independently based on different decision criteria and so may
    conflict. **Therefore,** form a council of one representative per
    circle to meet after the circle meetings to refactor the circle
    proposals into a consistent set of priorities and choices using
    [Leadership-as-a-Service](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/).
4.  **Rotate circle representatives:** Permanent circle representatives
    would just become command & control managers by another name.
    **Therefore,** rotate circle representatives onto councils
    round-robin so that, in every council meeting, every circle and
    every team is fully represented, and each team member gets turns
    sitting on their council.
5.  **Use mission command to maintain team autonomy:** Autonomous teams
    must determine how they will achieve a mission, but mission
    priorities must be aligned across teams. **Therefore,** let each
    team choose to deliver whichever unstarted Feature is the highest
    priority according to its council. To maintain team autonomy,
    however, let teams negotiate trade-offs on Treaties peer to peer
    with each team using
    [LaaS](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/)
    to determine which Treaties, if any, it will participate in.
6.  **Let Subject Matter Experts (\"SME\"s) attend councils:** often,
    cross-functional teams require expertise or services that only a few
    people possess. These people can\'t form permanent members of a
    single team as other teams also require them. but multi-tasking
    across teams causes stress that leads SMEs to organize into silos to
    control access. **Therefore,** let SMEs attend the council to inform
    decisions and collaborate peer to peer with circle representatives.

Self-Management Via Round Councils
----------------------------------

A command and control hierarchy reduces the number of conversations
needed for an organization to make timely decisions and orchestrate
their execution. Round Councils can be composed into a hierarchy to
achieve the same thing. This self-managing hierarchy offers three key
benefits over command & control:

1.  **All communication between doers and deciders is face to face.**
2.  **All decisions are made by groups no larger than a right-sized
    agile team.**
3.  **All decisions are continuously reviewed, enabling the organization
    to immediately and coherently respond to changes in market and
    technology constraints.**

Together these benefits dramatically accelerate the flow of learning
across the organization, enabling it to respond continuously and
coherently to changing technical, business and design constraints.

:::

Round Councils compose this way: as each Council involves the same
circle representation as its Teams, a set of \"Level Two Circles\"
meetings can be built out of multiple \"Level One Councils\". As with
the Level One Circles, Level Two Circles each provide a representative
to meet face to face at a Level Two Council.

And this Level Two Council prioritizes and refactors all the Level Two
Circles\' proposals so that the Level One Councils can negotiate
trade-offs on Treaties peer to peer. with each Level One Council using
[LaaS](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-service-peter-merel/)
to determine which Treaties, if any, it will participate in. And the
work items prioritized by the Level Two Council define missions and
metrics for the Level One entities \...

So the pattern of Circles and Councils can be continued upwards to align
decisions across streams, then across portfolios of streams, and so on
all the way to board scope for an entire business. With all Circles and
Councils operating at all levels on the same cadences.

Rotation Patterns
-----------------

Many council rotation patterns are possible. The primary criteria for
selecting a rotation pattern are:

1.  Every subsidiary council and circle must be represented in every
    council. Where, at level one, the subsidiaries are simply teams, not
    councils.
2.  Except in a teaching context, every council must include a selection
    of members who were on the previous council, so that every council
    understands why the previous council made the decisions it did.
3.  Where there are multiple levels of council, the rotation at one
    level should only move a click after a complete cycle of those at
    the level below, so that every person will wind up circulating
    through all the councils in the manner of the second, minute and
    hour hand revolutions of a clock.

:::

An example rotation pattern for three six-circle teams is shown in the
graphic here. This is the pattern we\'re using in the \"Code Without
Thrones\" experiments. Each row represents a Circle and each column
describes the membership of a Council.

This rotation pattern enables us to interleave the different activities
so that they synchronize the flow of learnings across the teams and
streams. While this may seem as complex as a square dance, it\'s very
simple for each team member. Each spends two cycles as a member of a
stream council, then two cycles refactoring work products, and then two
cycles attending Portfolio circles where they have a one in three chance
of attending the Portfolio Council.

:::

We\'re still playing with finding the best timings for these things \...
and then the whole thing repeats, everything on the same cadence regular
as clockwork. Everyone gets to align their ideas in an immediate,
orderly way with those of their colleagues. To stop that from seeming
complicated (as in the picture below), we\'re printing these rotations
up on a set of playing cards. One per player \...

A fractal alignment pattern enables large groups to self-manage with
zero command and control. Round Councils accelerate learning by
eliminating the social distance between doers and deciders, empowering
autonomous teams to continuously align their responses to changing
constraints. \#descaling \#businessagility \#devops \#patterns \#xscale
