    Despite the fuss that\'s been made of its Japanese name and Lean
    origins, a Kanban is just a card wall where you pull cards toward done
    from the right rather than pushing them into progress on the left.
    Pulling toward done minimises work in progress, which is good for ROI
    and related measures.

Despite the fuss that\'s been made of its Japanese name and Lean
origins, a Kanban is just a card wall where you pull cards toward done
from the right rather than pushing them into progress on the left.
Pulling toward done minimises work in progress, which is good for ROI
and related measures.

But what\'s a 3D Kanban? The obvious 3 Ds are Design, Delivery and
DevOps laid out as if they were stacked on top of each other. Looks a
bit complicated, especially if you\'re used to a 3-column Scrum board.
Turning something simple into something complicated doesn\'t seem like
an achievement \... unless there\'s another benefit?

Business Agility requires Design, Delivery and DevOps to work
continuously, hand-in-glove. Self-directing portfolios of self-managing
streams of self-organising teams. Relations between many different
kanbans make this harder to do and time spent keeping all the boards
lined up with each other is kind of painful. So in this respect a 3D
Kanban could be simpler. But there\'s a bigger benefit \...

The Beauty of Breadth-First
---------------------------

On a 3D Kanban we only split work items into smaller pieces when we
actually need the pieces. Boxing work up breadth-first rather than
detailing long-ass product backlogs makes the context for prioritisation
decisions explicit. You can\'t just walk up the nearest foothill in a
highly dimensional design space and expect to discover Everest.
Breadth-first targets the global maximum of ROI rather than just some
local maximum.

Whether it\'s XSCALE
[XPM](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-product-management-xscale-language-peter-merel),
Devops [3rd
Way](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/),
Google\'s [Design Sprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2vSQPh6MCE),
or Lean\'s [Set-Based Concurrent
Engineering](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey_Liker/publication/248139929_Toyota%27s_Principles_of_Set-Based_Concurrent_Engineering/links/54d0dfb60cf20323c21a0069/Toyotas-Principles-of-Set-Based-Concurrent-Engineering.pdf),
breadth-first avoids exploring any part of the design space in depth
until there\'s a sketchy view of all of it.

Here we\'re using XSCALE concepts to chunk from Products down to
Stories. But you can use any breakdown structure you prefer so long as
you do it just in time to track a card\'s flow. Because less cards on
the board means less complexity and more

XSCALE\'s definitions of these things are minimalist:

-   **Products** are units of marketing and customer experience for some
    value streams.
-   **Epics** are business objectives relevant to bringing the Product
    to market.
-   **Features** are the smallest parts of an Epic with appreciable
    business value.
-   **Scenarios** are sets of
    [BDD](https://johnfergusonsmart.com/serenity-bdd/) acceptance
    criteria for a Feature.
-   **Stories are** segmentations of Scenarios that share
    [INVEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic))
    properties.

Of course you\'re free to bring your own distinctions to the cards on
your own Kanban. The point here is representing the structure
breadth-first. Think of the colours here as just a way to see how the
boxes on the right are always pulled directly out of the boxes on the
left. Let\'s follow the wall left to right and see how that works.

Walking The Wall
----------------

[Walking the
wall](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-3-things-do-standup-peter-merel)
is a kind of standup meeting you use to propel your workflow. You can
make your 3D kanban have a very different workflow to this one, which is
based on the

[XAP](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-agile-performance-xscale-practice-pattern-peter-merel)
and
[XBA](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exponential-business-agility-xscale-practice-pattern-language-merel)
patterns:

-   [**Canvas**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pirate-canvas-charting-service-ecosystem-exponential-growth-merel)
    means boiling business constraints and metrics down to an Epic
    landscape.
-   [**Analyze**](http://xscale.wiki/#Behavioral%20Product%20Planning)
    means figuring out what releasable Feature-sets are relevant to each
    Epic.
-   [**Estimate**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-bingo-peter-merel)
    means figuring out priority & budget per Feature to make a release
    plan..
-   [**Design/Test/Build/CI**](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html)
    is the classic agile SDLC.
-   **FIT** is Feature Integration Testing in a Production-Like
    Environment.
-   **SIT** is Systems Integration Testing in Production using a
    Dark/Canary/A-B flow.
-   **Science** is where we deploy, experiment and gather data to inform
    the Canvas work.

So long as BDD tests are written in Functional style their analytics can
be collected longitudinally to identify the bottleneck market
constraint. Models combining these analytics into metrics can be
combined with cumulative flow through a 3D Kanban to inform Throughput
